                                  How To Play-
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- (Red) is food.
- (Blue) is an orb
- (Purple) is a poisonous berry.
- Choose your character from a roster of 4 species of snakes.
- Navigate the character towards his food by using arrow keys.
- Everytime you feed the character, his length increases, and so 
  does your score.
- You can also collect orbs to gain abilities but beware of 
  the poisonous berries, which can and will kill your character.
- Collecting 5 orbs unlocks one of the two abilities of the 
  character: Invincibility or Slow Motion, both of which last for
  10 seconds each.
- Also, if the character hits the walls or its own body, it will 
  die and the game will be over.
- Try to feed the character as much as possible before it dies.

*Each character has a unique theme song, which you can activate by pressing Spacebar in game.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  This game is our attempt at recreating the famous Snake game on Nokia that 
you most probably would've played (Ah, the nostalgia :P). Initially, this 
was going to be a very simple and bland replica of the original snake game
for our school project but we kept adding bits and bits of extra stuff to it.
50-50 work was put into this by both of us.

  For the art design, we decided to give a calm retro 8-bit look to everything,
while also keeping them simplistic enough to not be a mess. The music we used
was also to support this 8-bit vibe.

  As for the game design, there's your basic snake game with an interactive 
main menu, multiple characters, pause screen and game over scrren, a 
'how to play' option for newbies, muting/unmuting music feature, 
orbs that give your snake abilities and poisonous berries that'll kill your snake.
